            <p id="cook">There’s cooking, and then there’s cooking with passion, creativity, and love. At Little Rae’s,
                we firmly believe that the energy you put into a recipe is just as important as the ingredients you use.
                And we’re not alone. Below is a collection of quotes about cooking from the heart that will make you
                look at food in a whole new light.</p>
